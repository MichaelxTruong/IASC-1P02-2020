						<p><b>Children inside all the time playing videogames or stuck on the computer?</b>
							<br /><br />Allow your children to experience a game outside of their screens. We promote an outdoor, fun, and active lifestyle by teaching the fundamental skills of soccer in an interactive and friendly manner.
							<br /><br />Mini Kicks offers four different on-the-field courses that cater to children as young as 3 years of age to 12-year-old pre-teens.
							<br /><br />	On those sunny days, let children play where they should. Outside!

							<br /><br /> We know it is difficult to find affordable, extracurricular activities for your kids outside of school.
							<br /><br /> That is why we have founded Mini Kicks!
							<br /><br /> So, anyone from any background can get involved in playing and staying active in a worry-free environment. </p>
