		<h2>Random Paragraph 1</h2>
			<p> She looked at her little girl who was about to become a
				<em>teen</em>. She tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry. It hit her all at once. She was no longer a little girl and she stood there
				<strong>speechless</strong> with
				<font color="orange">fear</font>,
				<font color="blue">sadness</font>, and
				<font color="purple">pride</font> all running through her at the same time.
			</p>
		<h2> Random Paragraph 2 </h2>
			<p> They <em>rushed</em> out the door, grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need. There was
				<strong>no time</strong> to double-check to make sure they weren't leaving something important behind.
				<font color="red">Everything</font> was thrown into the car and they sped off. Thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all.
